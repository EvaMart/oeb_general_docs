OpenEBench-related code repositories are mainly stored at `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__, under different organizations and groups,
but always inter-linked and accessible though the documentation hub:

.. centered:: https://openebench.bsc.es/docs/

Add a new repository to the Hub
===============================

The only requirement is to add OpenEBench as one of the topics of your repository.

```
Topic:openebench
```


Follow the official GitHub
documentation on `how to add topics to your repository <https://docs.github.com/es/github/administering-a-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics#adding-topics-to-your-repository>`__.

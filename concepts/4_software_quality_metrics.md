# Software quality metrics

As any product, software components may differ in their characteristics that overall may refer as a software quality. 
Although the number of quality characteristics or metrics may be extensively large, their weight in the overall 
perceived quality is different. Many of the metrics are quite similar and may be grouped in a few groups related to 
the software development process. “ISO/IEC 9126-1:2001 Software engineering - Product quality document” defines 
**usability**, **sustainability** and **maintainability** as a main software quality parameters. OpenEBench provides a model for 
more than 50 metrics to assess bioinformatics tools quality.

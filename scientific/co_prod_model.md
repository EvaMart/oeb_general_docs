# OpenEBench co-production model

The OpenEBench team encourages a co-production model together with
scientific communities and other stakeholders. The co-production model
will contribute towards the sustainability of the platform by making
other stakeholders part of it. Moreover, the co-production model will
contribute to implement relevant functionality and gather feedback about
it in order to refine it and maintain it. Indeed, the co-production
model is already being used in different European projects where
scientific benchmarking activities are foreseen as part of expected work
to be done.

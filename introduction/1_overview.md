# Overview

OpenEBench is an infrastructure designed to establish a benchmarking system for bioinformatics methods, tools and web services. OpenEBench is part of the ELIXIR Tools platform and its development is led by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) in collaboration with partners within ELIXIR and beyond.

OpenEBench is being developed so as to cater for the needs of the bioinformatics community, especially software developers who need an objective and quantitative way to inform their decisions as well as the larger community of end-users, in their search for unbiased and up-to-date evaluation of bioinformatics methods.

The goals of OpenEBench are to:

* Provide guidance and software infrastructure for Benchmarking and Techincal monitoring of bioinformatics tools.
* Engage with existing benchmark initiatives making different communities aware of the platform.
* Maintain a data warehouse infrastructure to keep record of Benchmarking initiatives.
* Expose benchmarking and technical monitoring results to Elixir Tools registry.
* Establish and refine communication protocols with communities and/or infrastructure projects willing to have a unified benchmark infrastructure Coordinate with Elixir.
* Interoperability Platform to keep FAIR data principles on Benchmarking data warehouse.

In OpenEBench you will be able to find three types of activities:

* **Scentific Benchmarking** that helps determine the precision, recall and other metrics of bioinformatics resources in unbiased scenarios, which have been set up through reference databases, ad-hoc input and test data sets reflecting specifying scientific challenges. Chosen metrics allow us to objectively evaluate the relative scientific performance of the different participating resources. It is even possible to understand what are the software potential biases, strengths and weaknesses and/or under which conditions do they perform better or worse.
* **Assessment of Research Software quality**, a specific infrastructure to monitor software quality, a series of quality metrics taken from a number of sources. The source of such metrics includes documents by the Software Sustainability Institute, recommendations for open source software development, or for software quality metrics. For each metric, a specific source of information have been chosen and the necessary interface implemented.
* **Software Observatory** that aims to monitor the technical quality of research software in the Life Sciences. This is achieved through a comprehensive collection of metadata from different sources, which along with additional computational means, allows the automatic generation of metrics.

Welcome to OpenEBench's documentation!
======================================

OpenEBench, the ELIXIR platform for benchmarking, aims to address the main challenges in the most important levels of benchmarking: 

* Scientific benchmarking related to the scientific quality of bioinformatics tools and workflows.
* Technical monitoring related to software quality.
* Performance benchmarking regarding the usability and efficiency of the technical deployment of bioinformatics tools, servers and/or workflows.

*TODO* : Graphical and simple explanation of the three sections (SCI/ASS/OBS) [wait for web homepage]

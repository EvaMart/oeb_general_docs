# Publish your data to OpenEBench

OpenEBench community managers and participants can upload the results of their benchmarking events to find them publicly available at the OpenEBench portal. The publication process is available online through the Virtual Research Environment, upon the organizator's event approval. Community managers can also push the data in a programmatic way using the corresponding REST API. Find more details below.

## Using the Research Environment

[ VRE --> Peticio --> Manager Approves --> Data pushed to data.OEB  and published ]

As seen in the Figure below, user execute the benchmarking workflow in the Virtual Research Enviroment. All user files, input and outputs datasets of the workflow are private for user. 
Then user can decide if they want to publish the datasets to OpenEBench. Only afterwards, the possiblity to publish the datasets to remote repository EUDAT will be allowed.

### What benchmkarking data can be published?
To publish data to OpenEBench portal, two types of datasets are allowed:
- **Participant dataset**: Produced by participants with their tool from a specific input data.
- **Consolidated dataset**: It includes participant data, assessment data and aggregation data. Generated once a benchmarking worflow has been successfully executed.

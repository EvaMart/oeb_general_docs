### What benchmkarking data can be published?
To publish data to OpenEBench portal, two types of datasets are allowed:
- Participant dataset: Produced by participants with their tool given a specific input data.
- Consolidated dataset: It includes participant data, assessment data and aggregation data. Generated once a benchmarking worflow has been successfully executed.

For more details, see the [Scientific Datasets](https://openebench.readthedocs.io/en/dev/technical_references/2_scientific_datasets.html#datasets-types-and-cross-references) reference.

:ref: `technical_references/2_scientific_datasets.`

.. note::
:ref: `technical_references/2_scientific_datasets.`


These datasets must belong to an active benchmaking event. (+ info - "evaluate your tool", how to know that).
As the process to publish includes to associate the data to a registered OpenEBench tool, participant tool must be registered in OpenEBench first in order to asign an OpenEBench id for the participant tool. 
(+ info - "Register your tool to OpenEBench")

### Why should I publish data to OpenEBench?
As metion before, OpenEBench is the benchmarking and technical monitoring platform for bioinformatics tools, web servers and workflows. Publishing data from the  benchmarking workflows implies:
- Data will become publicly available on the OpenEBench data portal.
- Data will receive a unique OpenEBench identifier: This allow user to afterwards refrencee that data in publications or publish it to a remote repository, B2SHARE.(+ info - "Publish your data to EUDAT")
- Data will be stored on the internal OpenEBecnh datastore (not persistent)
